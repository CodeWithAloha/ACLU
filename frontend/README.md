## CFH Add-ons

### prettier
Prettier helps keep code style standardized via auto-format.  It is currently hooked up to the project via eslint.  

- To format from the command line: `yarn run lint`;
- To format on save from your favorite code editor: `use the googles`

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
